# Heroku configuration file
# by default, Heroku uses JDK8, which isn't able to build our cxf-spring-boot-starter (although it can be used with JDK8)
# see https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/java-support#specifying-a-java-version
java.runtime.version=11
# we also need to specify the Maven version (see https://github.com/codecentric/cxf-spring-boot-starter/issues/48)
# maven.version=3.5.2
# but as there is no support for Maven >3.3.9 on Heroku, we need to switch to https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper
# which is also the recommended way to use Maven on Heroku https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/java-support#specifying-a-maven-version
